**NON BIT LOCKER MACHINES ONLY**

This script will output the logs to the Desktop for any local user to verify the removal of the files. I created a system service to auto run this as soon as the bootable USB loads.

IM VERY AWARE MICROSOFT RELEASED A TOOL.

This script was primarily made to act a as a back up in the event that recovery USB fails on some systems.
This has gone through very limited testing in my virtual environment, please let me know how I could improve it!
